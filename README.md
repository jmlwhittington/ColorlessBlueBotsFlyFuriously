## Installation and setup
To install the bot, download the latest release, drag the folder out of the *.RAR* archive, and place it wherever you intend to run the bot.

## Custom content
You can add your own content to the *.txt* files in the *Content* folders! Just ensure you mimic the format of entries already present in the files. Also, make sure your entries don't go above 300 characters (296 for *Error.txt*), or they won't post due to the character limit!
